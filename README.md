For the heap sort, we implemented it using a max-heap. Also, in our program, we implemented quick sort and merging sort of random data, reverse and sorted data. For the priority queue, we use a max heap, which keeps the highest priority task at the top and rearranges correctly after extraction. For both implementations, I use Visual Studio.
